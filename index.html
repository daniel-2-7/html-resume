    <h1>My Resume</h1>
    <p>
        This resume aims to recap my knowledge on the foundations of HTML language in the course taken in Udemy namely 
        "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu. Other than that, it is a portfolio I am working on to 
        enhance my knowledge on web development.

    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
        Hello! My name is Tan Zhi Xiang, and I am currently pursuing a computer science degree at the University of Leeds.
        My academic journey has sparked a keen interest in web application development, an area where I am constantly exploring 
        and experimenting to discover what truly resonates with me. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Throughout my course, I have gained valuable experience in web development, some of which you can find showcased on my GitHub account. 
        I am also working on several other projects that are in various stages of development and have yet to be uploaded. 
        Each project presents a new opportunity to learn, grow, and refine my skills.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        What fascinates me the most about web development is its inherent ability to foster creativity. The field offers endless possibilities to captivate users, 
        delivering engaging experiences that not only capture attention but also drive tangible results and profits. This dynamic environment allows me to blend technical 
        prowess with creative design, continually pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved online.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        As I embark on this exciting journey, I am eager to dive deeper into the world of web development, experimenting with new technologies and methodologies. 
        I am passionate about creating innovative solutions that are not only functional but also aesthetically pleasing and user-centric.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Thank you for visiting my profile, and I look forward to sharing my journey and projects with you!
